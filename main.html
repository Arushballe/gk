        <p>Hii baby, I have told you earlier that I am not good in creative wirting(which was a truthüòÖüòÖ).<br>
           But I will try to express and tell you how much I Love You.<br>
           I still remeber the first time we chatted on snapchat. I told you that I had a crush on you.<br>
           And you asked me that "Agar koi ladka h jiska hum par crush h toh use kaise patao?".<br>
           I told you that just propose him he will get ready to be in realtionship with you.
           And luckily that boy was me.<br>
           When you porposed me I was literally shaking and was confused if it was real or just a dream.
           And agreeing to be in realtionship with you was the best decision I have ever made.<br>
           Till now it has been more than a year(492 days).<br>
           And Whenever I go to Mandir I just pray to god that we should be together forever.<br>
           And we have to be together till the end of our lives.
           As you said that, " even if we fight we'll sort out and we'll stay. we've to make this work. we've to marry each other and go on honeymoons, have a family and die together. even after our 10th we'll not leave neither me nor you.".<br>
           I want to you know one more thing that you are always my first priority. But when you are with your friends I don't want to interrupt you in between thats why I don't come to you when you are with your friends.<br>
           And I will always love you more than anyone else.<br>
           And "always" means even after I am dead you will be the last person I loved so much.
           <br>So never ever think that I will leave you.
           I am just yours and only yours.
           Thank you for being in my life actually you are my life.
        <br>
